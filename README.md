# Model-based-MAET-conductivity-reconstruction
We proposed a novel model-based conductivity method in magneto-acousto-electrical tomography(MAET). The test datasets are in the Data.rar including 1D, 2D simulation, 2D phantom and 2D pork tissue. The paper has been published in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement titled "A novel nodel-based conductivity reconstruction in magneto-acousto-electrical tomography (MAET): Simulation and experiment study". Note that the segmentataion step in this method is graph cutting integrated in MATLAB Toolkit. If you test your own data, you should replace it with your segmentation method.
